   - Copy the entire contents
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

3. **Verify Setup:**
   - Check Tables: `profiles` table should exist with proper columns
   - Check Storage: `profile-pictures` bucket should be created
   - Check Policies: RLS policies should be active

## 🧪 **TESTING THE COMPLETE FLOW**

After running the database setup:

1. **Frontend Test:**
   - Open https://localhost:5174/
   - Go through signup process
   - Upload a profile picture in step 3
   - Complete registration
   - Verify navigation to main app

2. **Database Verification:**
