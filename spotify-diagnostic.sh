# Common issues checklist
echo "‚ùì Common Issues Checklist:"
echo "  1. Redirect URI in Spotify app EXACTLY matches: https://localhost:5174/auth/spotify/callback"
echo "  2. No trailing slashes or extra characters"
echo "  3. HTTPS is working (you should see a lock icon in browser)"
echo "  4. Client ID is correct: 423d596237724235a4fbbed742318be8"
echo "  5. Spotify app is not in development mode restrictions"

echo "üéØ Next Steps:"
echo "  1. Verify your Spotify app settings at: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard"
echo "  2. Make sure redirect URI is EXACTLY: https://localhost:5174/auth/spotify/callback"
echo "  3. Test the OAuth URL above manually in your browser"
echo "  4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors"

echo "  Expected behavior:"
echo "  - Should redirect to Spotify login"
echo "  - After login, should redirect back to your app"
echo "  - Should NOT show 'INVALID_CLIENT' error"
